# About Me

Hi, I’m Surya, a tech enthusiast fueled by curiosity and creativity. I love exploring new technologies, solving problems, and crafting innovative solutions that make an impact. Right now, I’m diving deep into cloud computing, web development, and automation—turning ideas into reality one line of code at a time.

When I’m not at my desk, you’ll likely find me experimenting with new tools, learning something exciting, or enjoying a quiet moment with coffee and my thoughts.
